# What is Isee Systems Stella and How Can It Help You Model Complex Systems?
  
Isee Systems Stella is a software that allows you to create dynamic models of complex systems using a graphical interface. You can use Stella to simulate and analyze various scenarios, test policies, and explore solutions. Stella can help you understand how systems work, how they change over time, and how they respond to interventions.

Stella is based on the principles of system dynamics, a discipline that studies the behavior of systems composed of interrelated elements. System dynamics helps you identify feedback loops, delays, stocks and flows, and nonlinear relationships that shape system behavior. By modeling these elements in Stella, you can gain insights into the causes and consequences of system behavior, and design strategies to improve system performance.
  
Stella is designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and accessible. You can build models using icons that represent different types of system elements, such as variables, converters, connectors, and functions. You can also use modules to organize your model into submodels that represent different aspects of the system. You can then run simulations and view the results in graphs, tables, or animations. You can also compare different scenarios using comparative runs, sensitivity analysis, or optimization tools.
  
Stella can be used for various purposes and domains, such as education, research, policy making, business, engineering, health care, environment, social sciences, and more. Stella can help you model systems such as population dynamics, epidemics, climate change, supply chains, economics, ecology, biology, chemistry, and more. Stella can also help you teach and learn about these topics using interactive models that engage students and foster systems thinking.
  
Stella is available in different versions and platforms to suit your needs. You can use Stella Online to create and share models on any device with a modern web browser. You can also use Stella Professional or Stella Architect to create models on your desktop computer with more advanced features and capabilities. You can also export your models to various formats such as HTML5 or C#, or embed them into websites or applications.

## How to Get Started with Isee Systems Stella
  
If you want to start modeling complex systems with Isee Systems Stella, here are some steps you can follow:
  
1. Choose a system that you want to model. It can be a real-world system that you are interested in or involved with, or a hypothetical system that you want to explore. You can also choose a system from the examples provided by Isee Systems or other sources.
2. Define the purpose and scope of your model. What question do you want to answer with your model? What level of detail do you need? What time horizon do you want to consider? What assumptions do you want to make?
3. Identify the main elements and relationships of your system. What are the key variables that influence or are influenced by the system? How do they change over time? How do they affect each other? What are the feedback loops, delays, stocks and flows, and nonlinearities that shape the system behavior?
4. Build your model in Stella using the graphical interface. Drag and drop icons that represent different types of system elements, such as variables, converters, connectors, and functions. Connect them with arrows to indicate causal relationships. Use modules to organize your model into submodels. Assign values and equations to your elements using the equation editor. Use the help menu or the online documentation to learn more about the features and functions of Stella.
5. Test and validate your model. Run simulations and check the results in graphs, tables, or animations. Compare your model behavior with historical data or expected behavior. Perform sensitivity analysis or optimization to test the robustness or effectiveness of your model. Debug and refine your model until you are satisfied with its accuracy and validity.
6. Analyze and communicate your model results. Use Stella to explore different scenarios, test policies, and design solutions. Use comparative runs, sensitivity analysis, or optimization to compare and evaluate different options. Use graphs, tables, animations, or stories to present and explain your model results. Share your model with others using Stella Online, HTML5 export, C# export, or embedding.

By following these steps, you can create dynamic models of complex systems using Isee Systems Stella. You can also learn more about system dynamics and systems thinking along the way. You can use Stella to model any system that interests you, and discover new insights and solutions that can help you make better decisions.
